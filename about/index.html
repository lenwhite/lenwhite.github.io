<h1 id="about-me">About me</h1>
<p>Software engineer, amateur home cook, and economics enthusiast. It's a little blase to just defined oneself in a bunch of labels, but you can't deny how convenient it is.</p>
<p>I write software for a living, mostly with Python and Typescript. It's not much but its honest work.</p>
<p>This is my antisocial media. No comments, no feed, this is just me shouting into the void as my zen. If you need to contact me for anything: I'm sure you'll find a way - you're a resourceful person (alternatively - don't find me, I'll find you).</p>

        A collection of personal notes, lessons, and learnings, contributing at the margin to the sum of human's knowledge. Or maybe just adding noise.
