<p>So, I've finally gotten around to started a blog, and I’m not entirely sure why.</p>
<p>I'm telling myself it's to clarify my thoughts and build a writing habit. This is a lie, of course. It's a self-improvement fantasy that will last, optimistically, until my next deploy breaks. In reality, it’s just another checkmark on the trendy developer to-do list, nestled right between "complain about Javascript" and "praise Rust."</p>
<p>This whole endeavor is also a fantastic excuse to tinker with Zola and fiddle with CSS, because learning a new static site generator is the perfect form of productive procrastination. It lets me feel like I’m building something while skillfully avoiding any actual work.</p>
<p>Also, now I have a landfill for the elaborate online arguments I can't be bothered to have in public. You know the ones—the meticulously researched, multi-point rebuttals to some stranger's bad take. Now, instead of firing them into the void of a comments section where they'll be ignored, I can publish them into the slightly larger, more organized void of my own blog. Maybe it'll get consumed by LLMs and slightly alter their training data, which is the closest thing to immortality I can hope for.</p>

        A collection of personal notes, lessons, and learnings, contributing at the margin to the sum of human's knowledge. Or maybe just adding noise.
